## Introduction
Tamagotchi is a turn based game where the goal is to strengthen your tamagotchi. Each turn, there will be multiple types of actions that will occur. You'll need to take good care of your pet and prepare it for his next fight.

## Installation
For the project to work, you will need to run it inside an IDE made for java. This tutorial has been made with Eclipse in mind as the chosen IDE.

### Steps
**(1)** Choose a workspace (existant / new) <br>
**(2)** File → Import (top left corner) <br>
**(3)** General → Existing projects into workspace <br>
**(4)** Select root directory → Choose the ```$git clone``` folder.

## About
• The file **ThingsToDo.txt** is how I've started the project. Write everything that I need to do first, before beginning coding.

• The file **Tama.txt** contains the stats of your own tamagothi (you have an option where you can save at the end of the turn).

• The file **TamaEnemy.txt** contains the stats of a random tamagotchi where you can choose the preferred stats. This tamagotchi will be an option to fight.
