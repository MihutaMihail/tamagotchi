The USER will have a choice before he starts the game
	→ New Game (this can be done even if a savefile exists) (this of course will overwrite the current savefile if the USER has decide to SAVE)
	→ Continue (this action will only be available if the USER has saved its current "Tamagotchi")

## Part 1
► Class "Tamagotchi"
	→ Name (nom)
	→ Energy (energy)
	→ Strength (force)
	→ Happiness (joie)
	→ Hunger (faim)
	→ Tiredness (fatigue)
	→ Cleanliness (propreté)
	→ N° of Victories (nbDeVictoire) 
	→ StrengthPenalty (malusForce)

► Create a counter for the number of turns passed (must be shown at the start of each turn)
	Each turn has 4 types of actions (a text must be shown for each action ie if the hunger increases 
										by a random action, a text indicating that the hunger has increased by a random action will be shown)
	
	► Action made by USER (the USER has to choose 1 of the 4 options per turn). Each action REQUIRES 1 Energy
		→ Feed the "Tamagotchi"
			→ Hunger = 0 | StrengthPenalty--
			
		→ Play Outside with your "Tamagotchi"
			→ Happiness = 10 | Tiredness++
			
		→ Wash the "Tamagotchi"
			→ Cleanliness = 10
			
		→ Pet the "Tamagotchi" →
			→ Energy = Strength + Happiness - Hunger - Tiredness | Tiredness = 0
			
	► Action per turn (this happens every turn)
		→ Hunger++
		→ Tiredness++
		→ Cleanliness--
		→ nbTurns++

	► Random action per turn (1 of the 3 options will be chosen randomly)
		→ Hunger++
		→ Tiredness++
		→ Cleanliness--
		
	► Actions based on a condition (the action may only happen when its condition is met)
		→ If Hunger > 7
			→ Happiness--
			→ Tiredness++
			→ Energy--
		
		→ If Tiredness > 7
			→ StrengthPenalty++
			→ Energy--
		
		→ If Cleanliness < 3
			→ Happiness--
			→ Energy--
			→ Strength--
	
		→ If Happiness	< 3 
			→ Tiredness++
			→ Energy--
			→ Strength--
		
► Show the "Tamagotchi" stats whenever they are modified

► A SAVE feature must be developed (the savefile will be called "Tama.txt")
	Order of attributes (in the savefile)
	→ Name (nom)
	→ Energy (energy)
	→ Strength (force)
	→ Happiness (joie)
	→ Hunger (faim)
	→ Tiredness (fatigue)
	→ Cleanliness (propreté)
	→ StrengthPenalty (malusForce)


## Part 2

► Create a list which contains multiple "Tamagotchi" (their attributes are randomly generated) (maybe 5/10 of them)
	→ Energy / Happiness / Cleanliness = 5-10 (between 5 and 10)
	→ Hunger / Tiredness / StrengthPenalty = 0-5 (between 0 and 5)

► After the 4 actions (PART 1) are done, we get a choice to 
	→ Fight a randomly generated "Tamagotchi" (there are several "Tamagotchi" and the USER has to fight 1 of them) (the "Tamagotchi" chosen will be random)
	→ Fight a "Tamagotchi" that has already been created (the "Tamagotchi" attributes will be put in a txt file that will be read to "import" the "Tamagotchi")
	 																															(name savefile : TamaEnemy.txt)

► When a fight starts, the strength of the USERs "Tamagotchi" and the enemies will be calculated
	→ Strength = (nbTurns / 10 - StrengthPenalty) + 1-10 (random number between 1 and 10)

► A fight will be based on whoever has the higher STRENGTH

► Whoever has the highest strength will win (if USER has won, modify N° of Victories)

► After the 4 actions (PART 1) are done AND the fight (PART 2) has been finished, a new turn will start
	However, before the turn starts the USER will be granted a choice
		→ Do you want to save your "Tamagotchi" and continue ?
			(this will save the current attributes of the "Tamagotchi" that the USER has)
		→ Do you want to save your "Tamagotchi" and exit ?
